# Gym Management System

## Objective / Aim
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust, web-based Gym Management System that digitizes and automates the daily operations of a fitness center. The system aims to replace manual record-keeping with a centralized platform for managing member enrollments, trainer assignments, subscription plans, and daily attendance tracking, ensuring operational efficiency and data accuracy.

## Description / Overview
This project provides a comprehensive digital solution for gym administrators to manage their business effectively. Users (Admin) can register new members with detailed profiles (including Date of Birth, Email, and Phone) and track their active status. The system facilitates the creation of flexible membership plans (defined by duration and price) and handles the enrollment process seamlessly. Additionally, it features a daily attendance logging system to monitor member activity. By integrating specific management modules for Members, Trainers, and Plans, the system offers a holistic view of the gym's performance promoting a professional and organized fitness environment.
